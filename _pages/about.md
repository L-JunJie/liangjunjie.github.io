I come from Jintian Town, Guiping City, Guangxi, China, which is the starting point of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom movement. I used to study embedded systems and obtained a bachelor's degree from Tianjin University of Technology in 2021. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree at Nanjing Normal University, where I am studying human activity recognition, ubiquitous computing, and deep learning under the supervision of Associate Professor Lei Zhang. I have a strong interest in deep learning, particularly in the fields of object detection and image generation. Currently, I am interning and learning about YOLO object detection. I am also a cat lover and really enjoy spending time with kittens. Occasionally, I play games to relax and relieve stress.
